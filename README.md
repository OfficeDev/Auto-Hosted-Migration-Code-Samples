Auto-Hosted-Migration-Code-Samples
==================================

Code Sample that shows a Auto Hosted Project migrated to a Provider Hosted Project.

The sample includes two Visual Studio 2013 solutions. Both solutions use a Azure SQL Database and Azure web site for the RemoteWeb of the app built using the cloud app model (CAM). They demonstrate how to take an existing autohosted app and migrate to a provider-hosted app using the guidance published in the white paper [MSDN - How to: Convert an autohosted app for SharePoint to a provider-hosted app](http://msdn.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/office/dn722449(v=office.15).aspx).
